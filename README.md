# Current - Sprint 1 - Sticky note done. Working on file now

## Sprint 1 (starting pieces)
### 1. Add a set of initial starting elements (sticky note, file, weblink)
### 2. Make sure the starting elements are resizable and draggable
### 3. Add necessary styling to the elements - should look good, with drag effect

## Sprint 2 (addable pieces)
### 1. Change the speed dial to have three options, with three different icons (googledoc, website, sticky notes)
### 2. Create the functionality for websites - on click, opens a modal to enter the link
### 3. Create the functionality for googledoc/sheets/slides - on click, opens a modal to enter the link - recognizes if it is a doc/sheet / slide, and changes icon accordingly
### 3. Create the functionality for the sticky notes - on click, new sticky note of default size appears



## Notes: For the addable pieces, lets start with (googledocs/slides/sheets, websites, sticky notes). Let's have an opinion that these are the most important 3 things to have in a project box
