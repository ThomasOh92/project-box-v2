# Current - Think about remaining clean up before demo video
## - Adding the ability to name your links? or we could just simulate it for the demo
## - Controlling the box boundaries
## - Sorting out the header area (delete? editable?)
## - dark mode?

### Note: Remember the real value of this is about simplicity and instant usability. Miro and the other products are too fully featured
### Notes about the value :
#### For each project, you are going to have one simple box. I would rather sacrifice extra features if it is going to clutter the simplicity. No nested pages, no complicated learning curve - I want users to 'get it' right away

#### Ease of Use: A tool that is intuitive and easy to understand right off the bat can be a refreshing alternative to more complex productivity tools. Users could save time and cognitive load by not having to learn how to navigate a complex system.

#### Unified Workspace: By creating a single box for each project, users can keep their focus on one thing at a time. The convenience of having all necessary resources (tasks, notes, calendar events, documents, links) in one place could reduce the mental friction of switching between different apps or tools.

#### Design: A clean, well-designed interface that prioritizes simplicity can enhance the user experience significantly. Good design can make the tool more pleasant to use and help users more easily understand and navigate the platform.




~~ Sprint 1 (starting pieces)~~
~~ 1. Add a set of initial starting elements (sticky note, file, weblink)~~
~~ 2. Make sure the starting elements are resizable and draggable~~
~~ 3. Add necessary styling to the elements - should look good, with drag effect~~

~~## Sprint 2 (addable pieces)~~
~~ 1. Change the speed dial to have 5 options, with different icons (google doc, sheet, slides, link, stickynote)~~
~~ 2. Create the functionality for googledoc/sheets/slides/websites - on click, opens a modal to enter the link~~
~~ 3. Create the functionality for the sticky notes - on click, new sticky note of default size appears~~
