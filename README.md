# Current - Sprint 2 Start! Step 3

~~ Sprint 1 (starting pieces)~~
~~ 1. Add a set of initial starting elements (sticky note, file, weblink)~~
~~ 2. Make sure the starting elements are resizable and draggable~~
~~ 3. Add necessary styling to the elements - should look good, with drag effect~~

## Sprint 2 (addable pieces)
~~ 1. Change the speed dial to have 5 options, with different icons (google doc, sheet, slides, link, stickynote)~~
~~ 2. Create the functionality for googledoc/sheets/slides/websites - on click, opens a modal to enter the link~~
### 3. Try to pull the site header/title for the link text
